<p>One of the most important features of <strong>itom</strong> is its plugin system. Using plugins, <strong>itom</strong> is able to communicate with many hardware components, such as framegrabbers, cameras, motor stages or other devices. Furthermore it is possible to develop user defined algorithms in C/C++ and put them into an algorithm plugin. The call to these algorithms is then possible via the Python scripting language or other plugins.</p>
<p>The <strong>itom</strong> setup already comes with a small part of exemplary plugins. Other plugins are available as source files in the corresponding plugin repository (<a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/itom/plugins">https://bitbucket.org/itom/plugins</a>). Furthermore, the SDK of <strong>itom</strong> provide some template files for creating your own plugin using CMake and the development environment of your choice (see <a class="reference external" href="http://itom.bitbucket.org/latest/docs/07_plugins/development/pluginCreateCMake.html">http://itom.bitbucket.org/latest/docs/07_plugins/development/pluginCreateCMake.html</a>).</p>
<div class="section" id="add-a-plugin-to-itom">
<h2>Add a plugin to itom<a class="headerlink" href="#add-a-plugin-to-itom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For loading a plugin library at startup of <strong>itom</strong>, the following things must be met:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The plugin library is contained in any subfolder of the folder <strong>plugin</strong> contained in the application (root) directory of <strong>itom</strong></li>
<li>If <strong>itom</strong> is build in debug, the plugin must be compiled in debug as well. The same holds for the default release versions.</li>
<li>If the plugin depends on further 3rd party libraries, these libraries must be accessible by your operating system (on Windows: Their path must be contained in the PATH environment variable OR the necessary DLLs must be in the <strong>lib</strong> subfolder of <strong>itom</strong> or in the root directory of <strong>itom</strong>). Only if the plugin is able to load further libraries by means of a delay load mechanism, it is possible to also put 3rd party libraries in arbitrary folders.</li>
<li>If your plugin depends on 3rd party libraries, please make sure that all plugins use exactly the same version of the same library.</li>

<li><p class="first"><strong>CMU1394 - firewire cameras via generic CMU driver</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This plugins provides generic firewire camera support based on CMU-Driver version 6.4.6. CMU 6.4.6 works for firewire specifications &lt;= v1.30. This library is currently developed and tested under Windows only. Tested with PointGrayResearch Firefly and AVT Marlin.</p>
<p>In order to run this plugin you also need to install the CMU1394 drivers that can be obtained as installer from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/</a>. Together with this plugin parts of the drivers (some header files and static libraries for 32 and 64bit) in version 6.4.6 are shipped and linked to this plugin at comile time. Therefore you need to install the drivers for the same version as well. Otherwise you can also change the files in the corresponding source folder of this plugin.</p>
<p>This plugin is released under the LGPL license (CMU1394 is LGPL licensed, too).</p>
</div></blockquote>

<li><p class="first"><strong>DummyGrabber - virtual white noise grabber</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The DummyGrabber is a virtual camera which emulates a camera with white noise.</p>
<p>The camera is initialized with a maximum width and height of the simulated camera chip (both need to be a multiple of 4). The noise is always scaled in the range between 0 and the current bitdepth (bpp - bit per pixel). The real size of the camera image is controlled using the parameters x0, y0, x1 and y1 if the sizes stay within the limits given by the size of the camera chip.</p>
<p>This plugin can also be used as template for other grabber. For the simulation of real measurement systems, please also check the plugin &#8216;emulationGrabber&#8217;</p>
<p>This plugin is released under the LGPL license.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>FileGrabber - a virtual grabber that loads images from files</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This plugin emulates a camera by grabbing images from files in a specific folder on the hard disk. Alternatively, it is possible to iteratively load images from a 3D-data object (stack). The first possibility uses the command imread from OpenCV (OpenCV library highgui required).</p>
<p>The grabber can work in 3 different modes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Files in a specified folder are sequentially loaded each time a getVal / copyVal is performed. At the moment only 8 and 16 bit images are supported.</li>
<li>Images are sequentially loaded from a 3D data object (stack of images). Each getVal / copyVal returns a reference/copy to the specific plane of the stack. Supports 8, 12, 14, 16, 24-bit.</li>
<li>Files in a specified folder are scanned and preloaded to an image stack. Each getVal / copyVal returns a reference/copy to the specific plane of the stack. Supports 8, 12, 14, 16, 24-bit.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the second case, provide the objectStack argument, arguments bpp and sourceFolder are ignored. bpp is generated by the type and value range of the objectStack.</p>
<p>This plugin is released under the LGPL license.</p>
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Camera plugin that uses the FireGrab driver from the AVT FirePackage in order to communicate with corresponding cameras. The cameras are connected to the computer via firewire.</p>
<p>This plugin can only be loaded and used once the AVT FirePackage driver has been correctly installed on your computer. For more information about AVT FirePackage and their license browse to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.alliedvisiontec.com">http://www.alliedvisiontec.com</a>. This plugin was mainly tested with the cameras AVT Malin, Guppy and Pike. Not all parameters are supported by this plugin.</p>
<p>This plugin is released under the LGPL license. You need an installed AVT FirePackage driver, which requires further licenses if you are not using any AVT camera (see AVT FirePackage documentation).</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>OpenCVGrabber - OpenCV Video Capture (USB-Cameras, Firewire CMU1394)</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This plugin wraps the video capture framework of OpenCV. Therefore it requires further libraries of OpenCV (core, highgui, improc and partially tbb).</p>
<p>Usually all ordinary USB cameras are supported. If you compiled OpenCV with the CMU1384 flag, these firewire cameras are supported as well. Currently, a queuing problem in the Windows version for USB cameras exists. Therefore the plugin requests multiple images per frame in order to finally get the newest one. Therefore this implementation is not the fastest connection to any USB cameras.</p>
<p>Some supported cameras are only available if OpenCV is compiled with their support, e.g. CMU1394 (not included per default in pre-compiled binaries of OpenCV.</p>
<p>This plugin is released under the LGPL license.</p>
