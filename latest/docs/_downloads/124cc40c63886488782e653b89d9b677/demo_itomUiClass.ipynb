        "# ItomUI class\n\nDemo to show how to create a user interface in an object oriented approach.\n\nThis demo uses the base class ``ItomUi`` from the module ``itomUi``. This module\nis distributed with itom and can directly be imported (located in the itom-packages\ndirectory).\n\nThe proposal is to create one class, that represents all code, that is related\nto one ui file. This class is therefore derived from ``ItomUi``.\n\nThe benefits are:\n\n1. It is possible to create member methods in your class, that are automatically\n   called if the user does a specific action in the user interface (e.g. clicks\n   a button). For this, the method needs to have a specific method name. Then,\n   this method is considered to be a ``slot`` and is automatically connected with\n   the ``signal``, that is emitted due to the action. Methods, that should be\n   auto-connected slots must be decorated with the @ItomUi.autoslot decorator.\n\n2. Use the factory function ``ItomUi.disableGui`` for with statements to\n   switch some items of the GUI to a specific state (disable, enable, hide, show)\n   before starting a long operation and automatically switch back to the previous\n   state at the end of the operation. Even if the operation fails with an unhandled\n   exception, the GUI is reverted to the original state.\n"
