Besides compiling **itom** from the sources, there are binaries for the Windows version of **itom** (32/64bit).
These binaries contain the core application of **itom** together with a small selection of plugins and most designer plugins
that provide the plot and figure widgets of **itom**.

The installers are available in a default version and an All-In-One version. The default version simply contains **itom** and
the necessary runtime libraries while the all-in-one solution also contains 3rd party dependencies that can be installed as optional
component. These components are:

* Python 3.3
* Numpy 1.7
* Scipy 0.12
* Matplotlib 1.2
* Pillow 2.0

The latest version 1.0.14 is available from

* `<https://bitbucket.org/itom/itom/downloads>`_ or
* `<http://sourceforge.net/projects/itom/files/v1.0.14/>`_

Older versions are only hosted at sourceforge.net:

* `itom 1.0.13 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/itom/files/v1.0.13>`_
* `itom 1.0.12 <http://sourceforge.net/projects/itom/files/v1.0.12>`_
