**Simulationmodel of a High Precision Nanomeasure- and Positioning Machine**


In this example, **Itom** is used to create a simulation model of the Nanomeasure- and Positioning Machine from Instut fuer Technische Optik ITO Stuttgart.

The 3D-plot in the middle shows the position error vectors of each position in the working space.
To simulate measurements, a certain amount of points can be loaded into this space and the distances between these points in dependence of the error vectors are computed.
One possibility to plot the result is a histogram, shown below.
To the right side of **MainWindow** one can type in coordinates for new points, choose parameters to alter their positions or create new plots such as Figure 102.
