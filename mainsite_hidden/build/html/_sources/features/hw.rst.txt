Hardware
=====================

One main feature of ITOM is its simple integration of hardware:

* Hardware (Grabber, A/D convertes, raw IO, actuator) can be included as hardware plugins
* Homogenous hardware implementation (use of same script to control different devices of same hardware type)
* Complex algorithms, filters, GUIs or widgets can be included as software plugins
* Already implemented plugins: `Plugins <../plugins.html>`_
