Speckle
======================================

Simple waveoptical simulations can be easily performed using the
matrix computation capabilities of itom in combination with
perfect visualization options.

Here you see the simulation of a speckle pattern that one obtains
on a camera when imaging a rough surface illuminated by coherent
light. The average "size" of the speckles depends on the F-number of
the imaging system (and the wavelength).
